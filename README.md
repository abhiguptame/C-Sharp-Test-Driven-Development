### Process that uses unit tests to drive the design of software.

## Red, Green and Refactor:
### 1. Red: Creating a test that will fail
### 2. Green: updating a test to pass
### 3. Refactor: updating our code to meet coding standard and minimie duplication

## Testing Tools:
### 1. MSTest
### 2. NUnit
### 3. xUnit
### 4. MbUnit
